### Problem 1: InstaCart

The Instacart dataset illustrates the online grocery orders of their
application users. The dataset contains 1384617 observations of 131209
unique user ID’s, with each row representing an item from an order.
There is one order per user in this dataset.

There are 15 variables in this dataset, including:

- `order_id`: order identifier

- `product_id`: product identifier

- `add_to_cart_order`: order in which each product was added to cart

- `reordered`: 1 if this prodcut has been ordered by this user in the
  past, 0 otherwise

- `user_id`: customer identifier

- `eval_set`: which evaluation set this order belongs in (Note that the
  data for use in this class is exclusively from the “train” eval_set)

- `order_number`: the order sequence number for this user (1=first,
  n=nth)

- `order_dow`: the day of the week on which the order was placed

- `order_hour_of_day`: the hour of the day on which the order was placed

- `days_since_prior_order`: days since the last order, capped at 30, NA
  if order_number=1

- `product_name`: name of the product

- `aisle_id`: aisle identifier

- `department_id`: department identifier

- `aisle`: the name of the aisle

- `department`: the name of the department

There are 134 aisles in this dataset. The aisles that have the most
ordered items are the fresh vegetables, fresh fruits, packaged
vegetables fruits, yogurt, packaged cheese aisles, respectively.

The following plot will illustrate the number of items ordered in each
aisle:

``` r
ggp_aisle_plot =
  instacart |>
  group_by(department, aisle) |>
  summarize(total_items_ordered = sum(add_to_cart_order)) |>
  filter(total_items_ordered > 10000) |>
  arrange(department, desc(total_items_ordered)) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(aisle, -total_items_ordered), y = total_items_ordered, fill = department)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(
    title = "Number of Items Ordered in Each Aisle (Aisles with >10,000 items) - Grouped by Department",
    x = "Aisle",
    y = "Number of Items Ordered",
    fill = "Department"
  ) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma_format(scale = 1e-3)) +
  scale_x_discrete() +
  scale_fill_viridis_d(direction = -1) +
  scale_color_viridis_d(direction = -1)
```

    ## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'department'. You can override using the
    ## `.groups` argument.

This table includes the three most popular items in each of the aisles
“baking ingredients”, “dog food care:, and”packaged vegetable fruits”

``` r
popular_items_table =
  instacart |>
  filter(aisle %in% c("baking ingredients", "dog food care", "packaged vegetables fruits")) |>
  group_by(aisle, product_name) |>
  summarize(order_count = sum(add_to_cart_order)) |>
  group_by(aisle) |>
  do(top_n(., 3, wt = order_count))
```

    ## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'aisle'. You can override using the
    ## `.groups` argument.

This next table shows the average hour of the day Pink Lady Apples and
Coffee Ice Cream are ordered.

``` r
apples_coffee_table =
  instacart |>
  filter(product_name %in% c("Pink Lady Apples", "Coffee Ice Cream")) |>
  group_by(product_name, order_dow) |>
  summarize(mean_hour = mean(order_hour_of_day, na.rm = TRUE)) |>
  mutate(
    product_name = factor(product_name, levels = c("Pink Lady Apples", "Coffee Ice Cream")),
    order_dow = factor(order_dow, levels = 0:6, labels = c("Sunday", "Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday"))
  ) |> 
  pivot_wider(names_from = order_dow, values_from = mean_hour)
```

    ## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'product_name'. You can override using the
    ## `.groups` argument.
